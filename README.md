# Whoa, it's me!

I'm that one person from LPU. I made [crashlink](https://github.com/N3rdL0rd/crashlink) and probably a couple of other modding projects here or there.

I do CTFs with [valgrind](https://valgrindc.tf/). If you like what we do, you should [apply to join](https://valgrindc.tf/posts/apply)!
